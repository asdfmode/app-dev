The Super Mario Bros. Movie(ザ・スーパーマリオブラザーズ・ムービー Za Sūpā Mario Burazāzu Mūbī?, The Super Mario Bros. Movie) is a 2023 animated film directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, co-directed by Pierre Leduc and Fabien Polack from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel, and is based on the Super Mario game series. In the film, Mario and Luigi, two struggling plumbers, work underground in Brooklyn to fix a water main, but they end up being separated after being sucked into the Warp Zone via a mysterious pipe, with Mario ending up in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Luigi ends up in the Dark Lands. Mario then teams up with Princess Peach and Toad, and the three of them go on an adventure to stop Bowser's world-conquering plans and rescue Luigi from him. Produced by Illumination Entertainment and Nintendo, it was released on April 5, 2023 and rated PG for action and mild violence.
